1. How to unset the rightmost set bit of a number

    n & (n-1)

2. Check if the given integer is a power of 2 without using any branching or loop.

    n & (n-1) is the web answer but my gut feeling is
    n & 1 will also work

3. Find position of the rightmost set bit

        (n & (n-1)) ^ n

4. Find position of the only set bit in a number

        (n & (n-1))

        and

        log(number)
